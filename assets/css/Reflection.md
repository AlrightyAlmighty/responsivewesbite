Reflection on Project 1: Responsive Website

As someone who has had no prior experience coding, this assessment has been one of the most challenging, yet intriging experiences I have ever had. 

Working up the courage to start this assessment was difficult. I was incredibly intimidated by the language and regularly became frustrated as I was met by obstacle after obstacle. Each day I didn't code I became more and more anxious about forgetting what I'd learnt which only served to deter my learning even more. I am so very thankful to my classmate, Mitchell Bartlett, who sat with me for hours and painstakingly picked through my code to find the breaks until I was able to recognise the breaks myself. I could not have completed this assessment without him.
