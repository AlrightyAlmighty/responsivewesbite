#**Reflection on Project 1: Responsive Website**#

As someone who has had no prior experience coding, this assessment has been one of the most challenging, yet intriging experiences I have ever had. 

When I first began this project, I took great interest in researching the different techniques websites implemented to serve their brand image. Websites like [Frankie](https://www.frankie.com.au/) and [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/?%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&lpurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.headspace.com%3Fgclsrc%3Daw.ds%26&~ad_set_id=72181210273&~campaign_id=1940234794&~channel=g&~keyword=headspace&~placement&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmPSSBhCNARIsAH3cYga5nELw15RfSCqdVtF9YLoEJ0vFjfOF5g9JUbSrDvFavTXBZqwS1TQaAoIFEALw_wcB&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmPSSBhCNARIsAH3cYga5nELw15RfSCqdVtF9YLoEJ0vFjfOF5g9JUbSrDvFavTXBZqwS1TQaAoIFEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&%24web_only=true&_branch_match_id=973718026449198014&utm_source=Google%20AdWords&utm_medium=paid%20advertising&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA72QXW%2BCMBSGf025Gx8tDllCFkTIdGab4pa5G3Jsa1ErrZTZ%2BO8HXvgTlpybc568eU7euuu0efK8mgMzGih%2FsHzrgtau3DdHj3ugzWwcK%2FPGts8Ih0QnUAmlhOQVMKtaZpz%2BDNLC1VSMcz3kkh1Iwx2pf1uZ1IMCkRThoh9rrXuXuVSdECkElaaliEzBuswg%2FOigKAdWGd5Ve5ZEOBgHOPBxRAZA4aRhL5oBBXHoYxJGcXgjNTQNl4kYliO%2FDu8ld5nTa%2FpIdvBfs%2BXBnj7KclJnb%2BlqZtIXQjcCRk2%2BsMFotSuzM%2FvqinizUPncvxSH3XsxEvH8c1u200sBl%2FX35Odsy2C9hFTNijxd2MrSyT8p%2BrKSW1V%2FCUjCvL4BAAA%3D) had me mesmorised and I was desperate to create something as intricate as their site. I quickly realised how unachievable that would be. My final website was heavily inspired by the Geek Markets (website currently down), [The Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org.au/) and [Minus 18](https://www.minus18.org.au/). I liked the way these sites utilised gridding and boxes to further their designs. I was particularly drawn to how [Minus 18](https://www.minus18.org.au/) used cards to make their news stories stand out. As such, I pushed myself to learn how to create them so I could  incorporate them into my website.

My initial intention, when designing my lofi prototype, was to create a website that exaggerated colour and the grid system to create interest whilst keeping the design simple. My design changed a lot as I began to code and realise what I was actually capable of, but I still feel

Working up the courage to start this assessment was difficult. I was incredibly intimidated by the language and regularly became frustrated as I was met by obstacle after obstacle. Each day I didn't code I became more and more anxious about forgetting what I'd learnt which only served to deter my learning even more. I am so very thankful to my classmate, Mitchell Bartlett, who sat with me for hours and painstakingly picked through my code to find the breaks until I was able to recognise the breaks myself. I could not have completed this assessment without him.
